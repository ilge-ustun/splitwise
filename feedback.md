1. Do you have LLM docs to feed to AI?
2. Huge docs - and maybe bcs of it some parts weren't updated (separate chain f.e.)
3. I used Protected data, and had troubles to find how to retreive and encrypt data (it worked at the end ðŸŽ‰)
4. Was not easy to find an info that for retreving data you need to submit an order from CLI, especially if before you didn't know there's also this piece of the puzzle.
5. Could be cool to have private tokens => private transactions. Wrapping inside normal ERC20 to private one?

Thank you for all your patience and help! I was happy to know more about TEEs and iExec!
